  <h1>Mission</h1>
  <p>
    VEC stands for Volunteering and education club. We are dedicated to making the world a better place. We have seen many negative impacts that have happened due to COVID-19, which has opened our eyes to think more of the community and how we (teens) can make a positive difference. This is when we decided to make the club and impact the society through it (VEC).
