Hi, I’m Abhinav and I’m a junior at Coppell High School. As the vice-president of the Volunteering and Education Club, I hope to create change by helping out the community. On top of volunteering, I love playing video games, watching Star Wars, and reading a good book. If you have any questions, just send me an email at axy0784@g.coppellisd.com.
