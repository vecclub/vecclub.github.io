Hello, my name is Siddharth Mylavarapu and I am a junior at Coppell High School. I joined VEC to help people who donâ€™t have enough resources to achieve their goals. I also like to try my best academically and always follow the Cowboys GRIT. When I have time I usually like to plan ahead or play games with my friends.
