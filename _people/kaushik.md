Hello, my name is Kaushik Balantrapu, and I am a 16 year-old 11th grader at Coppell High School. Learning is very important to me, and I make sure to do it in the form of computer science, programming, and other topics I am interested in. I have helped to foster this same drive for learning in those younger than me by volunteering at the Biodiversity Education Center and teaching children about certain aspects of the environment, why they are so important, and how to protect them. I have also volunteered for over 120 hours at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science and help to teach children and adults alike about the most fascinating aspects of science, engineering, and mathematics, as well as the joy of learning.
